# RESTAURANT-PAGE-WEBPACK
Made by Gabriel Hrastovic

The purpose of this project is to create a fake restaurant web page with all of its elements entirely generated by JavaScript, cleanly bundled up with npm webpack and JS modules. Added some media queries to make it somewhat responsive on mobile devices.
